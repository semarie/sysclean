.Sh NAME
.Nm sysclean
.Nd list obsolete elements between OpenBSD upgrades
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a | p
.Op Fl i
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a
.Xr perl 1
script designed to help remove obsolete files, users and groups, between
.Ox
upgrades.
.Pp
.Nm
compares a reference installation against the currently installed elements,
taking files from both the base system and packages into account.
.Pp
.Nm
is a read-only tool.
It does not remove anything on the system.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
lists obsolete filenames, users and groups on the system.
It excludes any used dynamic libraries.
It will report base libraries with versions newer than what's expected.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
All files mode.
.Nm
will not exclude filenames used by installed packages from output.
.It Fl i
With ignored.
.Nm
will include filenames that are ignored by default, using
.Pa /etc/sysclean.ignore .
.It Fl p
Package mode.
.Nm
will output package names that are using obsolete files.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "PKG_DBDIR"
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
The standard package database directory,
.Pa /var/db/pkg ,
can be overridden by specifying an alternative directory in the
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
environment variable.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/sysclean.ignore"
.It Pa /etc/sysclean.ignore
Files to ignore, one per line, with absolute pathnames.
.Pp
A line starting with
.Sq @user
or
.Sq @group
will be interpreted as user or group to ignore.
.Pp
Shell globbing is supported in pathnames; see
.Xr File::Glob 3p .
If the pattern matches a directory,
.Nm
will not inspect it or any files contained within.
For compatibility with the
.Xr changelist 5
file format, the character
.Sq +
is skipped at the beginning of a line.
.Pp
.Pa /etc/changelist
is implictly included.
.El
